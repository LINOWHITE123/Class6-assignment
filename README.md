## Steps to Create an Ubuntu Server on AWS:
## Sign in to AWS Console:

## Go to  AWS  Management Console and sign in with your credentials.

Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:

Click on "Services" at the top left, and under "Compute," select "EC2" to go to the EC2 Dashboard.

Launch Instance:

Click on "Instances" in the left sidebar and then click "Launch Instance" to start the instance creation process.

## Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image):

Select "Ubuntu" as the operating system. Choose the Ubuntu version that suits your needs (e.g., Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS).

Choose Instance Type:

Select an instance type based on your performance and resource requirements. For example, "t2.micro" is eligible for the AWS Free Tier.

## Configure Instance:

Configure instance details like the number of instances

Add Storage:

Specify the size and type of the root volume (EBS). The default settings are usually fine for most use cases.

## Add Tags (Optional):

Add tags to your instance for easier management and identification (e.g., Name: MyUbuntuInstance).

## Create Key Pair:

Select an existing key pair or create a new one. This key pair is used to securely connect to your instance via SSH.

## Launch Instance:

Click "Launch Instances" and AWS will start provisioning your Ubuntu server.


## To create user accounts for all team members on an Ubuntu server, follow these steps:

## Log into your server 

Use SSH to log into your server as the root user or a user with sudo privileges.

 

Copy code

ssh username@server_ip

Create user accounts:

Use the adduser command to create a new user. Replace username with the actual username of the team member.

 

Copy code

sudo adduser username

This command will prompt you to enter a password and fill in other user details. Repeat this step for each team member.

Set up SSH keys 

For better security, use SSH keys instead of passwords. Hereâ€™s how to set up SSH keys for a user:

## Generate an SSH key pair on the client machine:

Copy code

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

This will generate a public key (id_rsa.pub) 

Copy the public key to the server:

 

Copy code share via slack

 

Alternatively, you can manually add the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server.

Copy code

sudo mkdir -p /home/username/.ssh sudo touch /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys sudo vi /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys

Paste the public key into the authorized_keys file, then set the appropriate permissions:

 

Copy code

chmod 400 authorized_keys

Verify the new user accounts:

Log out of the server and try logging in with the new user accounts to ensure they are set up correctly.
